222 East 35th Street, #1C
An immensely spacious one bedroom, located on a beautiful, tree-lined block of Murray Hill. Details such as crown molding and curved archways complement a host of enticing features: Hardwood floors, a huge living room, and a windowed eat-in kitchen, just to mention a few. Has ample storage space, including four deep closets-two of which can be combined into a windowed bath. The space has a great flow, and is very quiet; could be used for a great home office.    The Gregory House is classic Manhattan Art Deco. The building has countless amenities, including a live-in Super, central laundry, bike storage and additional storage. Only a few blocks from the 6 train. Pets are no problem. Call or email to schedule a viewing.
