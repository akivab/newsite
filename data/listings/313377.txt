The quality and smart renovation of this home is apparent from the moment you enter the uplifting environment. Natural light from a full wall of windows floods the east-facing 12' X 19'5" living room and roomy 8' X 6'4" open kitchen. Cooks will delight in the renovated gleaming and plentiful kitchen cabinetry, marble countertops, excellent appliances, and marble floor in a user-friendly layout. Marble countertop between the kitchen and living room functions both as a serving area and a bar height island on the living room side. Using soft colors over the skim-coated walls and perfectly maintained honey-toned parquet floors, the living room and bedroom (each with their own almost new HVAC unit) feel even more expansive than their actual generous dimensions. The 11' X 15'2" corner bedroom, with ample closet space, enjoys constant light from a wall of east-facing windows and riveting open views from its large northern window. The photograph of the pristine renovated marble bathroom speaks for itself - take a look. Concealed cable wiring throughout the apartment. New electrical outlets. Remarkable amenities at no extra charge include: a roof-top gym and 50 foot heated indoor pool with panoramic views; jacuzzi; sauna; and a huge rooftop terrace. In addition there is: a bike room; a valet parking reasonably priced garage; and an extra-large, recently renovated and air conditioned laundry room. This full-service coop is meticulously maintained, has 24-hour doormen, and a spacious and welcoming lobby with very high ceilings and comfortable seating. Pied-a-terres, sublets, and pets are permitted. (
