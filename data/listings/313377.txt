The quality and smart renovation of this home is apparent from the moment you enter the uplifting environment. Natural light from a full wall of windows floods the east-facing 12' X 19'5" living room and roomy 8' X 6'4" open kitchen. Cooks will delight in the renovated gleaming and plentiful kitchen cabinetry, marble countertops, excellent appliances, and marble floor in a user-friendly layout.
