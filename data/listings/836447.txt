Enjoy your coffee and read the paper while the sun rises over the large southern facing balcony in this graciously proportioned corner one bedroom apartment with versatile bonus room. From the separate dining alcove to the large living room, and even in the thoughtful details such as the spacious walk-in closet off the master bedroom, this well-planned residence truly offers the comforts of home. The kitchen has been updated and provides ample counter space, and the master bedroom has both western and southern exposures. The bonus room adjoining the living room can be adapted to myriad uses as a home office, a nursery, a guest space, or to suit your vision. For your comfort, the apartment boasts exceptional privacy and quiet; your private balcony benefits from tranquil views of the tree-lined street below, and the master bedroom does not share a wall with any other residence. Sherman Towers is a pet-friendly, full-service doorman building with a garage, roof deck, laundry room and storage. If you are looking to enjoy some exercise Sherman Towers is next door to the New York Sports Club, and in the summer one can take a quick stroll to John Jay Park and enjoy the 145 foot lap pool and all its amenities. 363 East 76th Street is conveniently located near the 77th Street subway along with great shops and dining.
