Murray Hill: On the Rise. Manhattan changes rapidly. Developers, restaurateurs and city government all have an enormous impact on which neighborhood will become the next best investment... Recently, the Bowery area -- also known as the "new Meatpacking" as heard on Million Dollar Listing--was the next big thing. Now, NoMad (north of Madison Square Park, the area from 25th to 30th Streets and between 6th and Lexington Avenue) has become the new hot neighborhood. With new developments such as 10 Madison Square West, One Madison Park and Huys, NoMad is exploding. NoMad's current average price is $2,024/foot; compare that with the 2010-2012 average of $1,434/foot. That's a 30% increase.
